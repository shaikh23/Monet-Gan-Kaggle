# Monet Style Transfer with CycleGAN ðŸŽ¨

This repository contains my work for the Kaggle *I'm Something of a Painter Myself* competition.  
The challenge: generate Monet-style paintings from real-world photos using a **CycleGAN** architecture.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- **Competition**: [Kaggle GAN Getting Started](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started)
